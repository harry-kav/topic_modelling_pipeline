# topic_modelling_pipeline
 A reusable and academically rigorous LDA topic modelling pipeline covering preprocessing, eda, data visualisation, modelling, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation. This repo has a demo usecase for modelling topics within trip advisor reviews.

 =================================================================
 
 To use:

 Download the repo.

 Run the following command from inside the directory containing the scripts to install the required libraries:

 pip install -r requirements.txt

 Run the scripts in sequence preprocessing.py, eda.py, and modelling.py. 

 If running on your own dataset, make the following changes:
  - Add your data file (in csv form) to the Data folder.
  - Your data will need to be in csv form with a row for each document (or review, query etc.) and a column containing the raw text from the document.
  - In preprocessing.py, change file_name and text_col to the name of your data file and the text column if using your own dataset.
  - After running preprocessing.py, in eda.py change file_name to your processed filename (generated by preprocessing.py)
  - After running eda.py, in modelling.py change FILE_NAME to your ngrams_processed filename (generated by eda.py)
  - eda results will be displayed in the main directory, and modelling results can be found in the Results folder for each script run.
  - NOTE: eda results are overwritten each time eda.py is run, whereas all runs of modelling.py are saved separately in Results.
